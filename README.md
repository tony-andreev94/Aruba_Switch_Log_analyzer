# Aruba_Switch_Log_analyzer
This is a repository for a CLI based switch log analyzer application that takes a logfile as input, loops through each line of the diagnostics file and looks for specific error messages that might indicate a hardware issue with HP ProVision/ProCurve and "Traditional Aruba" switches.
