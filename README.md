# Switch_Log_Analyzer
This is a repository for a CLI based switch log analyzer application that takes a switch logfile as an input, loops through each line of the diagnostics file and looks for specific error messages that might indicate there is a hardware issue with HP ProVision/ProCurve or "Traditional Aruba" switches.

# Future plans:
To add a GUI(TkInter) with a browse button allowing the user to select a specific logfile to be analyzed.
